# AI Prep Tool - System Design Document

## 1. Overview
The AI Prep Tool is designed to improve student learning outcomes through adaptive questioning and reinforcement techniques. This document outlines the system architecture, data flow, and key components that enable the intelligent tutoring functionality.

## 2. System Architecture
### 2.1 Components
- **Frontend**: Mobile app for students to engage with the system.
- **Backend**: AI engine for question adaptation, user data processing, and performance tracking.
- **Database**: Stores student responses, question sets, and analytics.
- **Notification System**: Pushes questions and reminders at strategic intervals.

### 2.2 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native (iOS & Android support)
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI or Django for API endpoints)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- **AI Engine**: TensorFlow/PyTorch for question selection and response analysis
- **Notification System**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)

## 3. Data Flow
1. **Student Interaction**
   - Takes an initial assessment
   - Answers multiple-choice questions (10 choices per question)
   - Data is logged into the system

2. **AI Processing**
   - Analyzes incorrect responses
   - Reorders answer choices to prevent pattern recognition
   - Identifies mistake patterns (e.g., misreading, misinterpretation)

3. **Reinforcement Delivery**
   - Sends targeted push notifications with previously missed questions
   - Engages students throughout the day for retention
   - Updates student performance records dynamically

## 4. Personalization Features
- Collects **handedness** (left/right) and **gender** (male/female) to analyze cognitive learning trends
- Generates customized question sets based on mistake history
- Adapts difficulty dynamically based on student progress

## 5. API Endpoints
### 5.1 Authentication
- `/api/register` (POST) - Register new student
- `/api/login` (POST) - Authenticate student login

### 5.2 Question Management
- `/api/questions/generate` (GET) - Fetch AI-generated question sets
- `/api/questions/submit` (POST) - Submit student answers
- `/api/questions/missed` (GET) - Retrieve past incorrect questions

### 5.3 Performance Tracking
- `/api/performance/progress` (GET) - Fetch student progress report
- `/api/performance/errors` (GET) - Get most common mistake categories

## 6. Notification & Engagement
- Push notifications triggered based on missed questions
- Adjustable frequency settings to balance engagement and avoidance
- Gamification elements (streaks, achievements) to encourage participation

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Expand AI model for personalized learning styles
- Implement reward/leaderboard system to further incentivize student engangement and bolster effectiveness
- Develop API for integration with school LMS platforms

## 8. Security & Compliance
- **Data Encryption**: All user data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR and COPPA compliant for student data protection
- **Access Control**: Role-based authentication for students and educators

## 9. Deployment & Scaling Strategy
- Deployed on AWS/GCP with auto-scaling groups
- Containerized using Docker & Kubernetes
- CI/CD pipeline for continuous updates and improvements

## 10. Conclusion
The AI Prep Tool is built to provide a robust, adaptive learning experience by continuously analyzing student performance and reinforcing concepts. By leveraging AI-driven error detection, customized notifications, and engagement strategies, it ensures students improve their understanding efficiently.
